we can send data to topics using producer console or prducer Api
similarly we can take data using consumer console or consumer Api

we can send data from console using producer console or setting all the same used in producer-console in the procuder api which is intergared with jsp web application code
we can see the output on console using consumer console or we can use consumer api to get it sparkstreaming

CONSOLE used only for testing purpose and to see on screen and give from screen
where as API are used to connect with sources to get data or consumer API are used to get data from broker and load data to nosql ( uslay written in scala or java )


///////////////////////////////


Web Application --> Kafka --> Spark Streaming --> cassandra
*** kafka consumer is integrated with spark streaming
kafka producer is intergrated with web application ***

both producer and consumer are linked or common point is topic


1) How web data is written to Topic ?????? [ producer api is linked to web application data ]

ANS: 

KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<String, String>(kafkaProps);
ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, "web_data","web_data");
producer.send(record);

-- This creates topic names and adds data to it and we give all server details in props

or

we can write our manual data using producer-console


2) How consumer takes data from broker ????????

ANS:

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<String, String>(props);
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("customerCountries"));
ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
System.out.println("topic = "+record.topic()+ "partition = "+record.partition()+ "offset = "+record.offset()+ "customer = "+record.key()+ "country = "+record.value());
            
-- This takes topic data to it and we give all server details in props

or

we can print data on console using consumer-console


3) How Consumer gives topic data to spark streaming ??????? [ consumer api is linked with spark streaming api ]

ANS:

In spark streaming we use --packages to connect to kafka and kafkautils to get topics from kafka so automatically we will get all of our topics
